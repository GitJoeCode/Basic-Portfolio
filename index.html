            Utility worker with larger than life aspirations<br>
            After graduating from Humboldt State University with a biochemistry degree
            I was able to travel throughout Central America for three and a half months.
            During which I caught a fervor as well as the travel bug.  Since then I 
            continuing to travel whenever possible. My dream is to obtain a profession 
            that will allow me to have a career working remotely in whatever location I 
            so chose.  Hence I have enrolled in a full stack coding bootcamp with hopes
            of applying what I learn towards a web development position.
